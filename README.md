# StrictLogicSystem

I now have a new energy for contributions - I have a new idea that microtheories in Cyc are better to be replaced by instances of mathematical/scientific models, and the inference and reasoning should always occur bounded by an instance of a model of the Reality. I want to develop some implementation code for this - will it go into OpenCog or stay at my local opensource repos is less important...
